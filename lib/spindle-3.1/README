	The White Rabbit put on his spectacles. "Where shall
	I begin, please your Majesty?" he asked.
	"Begin at the beginning", the King said, very gravely,
	"and go on till you come to the end: then stop."

Spindle is an integrated linking, loading and decrunching solution for C64
trackmos.

The core of Spindle is a cutting-edge IRQ loader featuring extremely fast
scattered loading and decrunching, minimal RAM footprint, and state of the art
serial transfer routines.

On top of this, Spindle provides a linking framework that automates much of the
tedious work traditionally associated with trackmo development. By hiding the
details of the storage model, Spindle allows the demo coder to focus on
effects, transitions, and flow.

======== Release notes =======================================================

1.0	Initial release.
2.0	Introducing Spin. Improved performance. Page $0f00 free for use.
2.1	Performance upgrade; better and faster decruncher.
2.2	Stability upgrade:
	* Greater margins for serial transfer (optional, disable with -f).
	* More robust checksum protection during motor spinup.
	* Bus lock (write anything to all of dd02 in between loadercalls).
	* Better ability to detect host reset (triggers a drive reset).
2.3	New features:
	* Optional error injection to simulate realistic delays.
	* The X tag is more forcing, i.e. prevents all unnecessary loading.
	* The $c10 utility routine leaves the CPU I flag alone.
	* Disk ID can be specified.
3.0	New features:
	* The C64-resident code now occupies one page of RAM of the user's
	  choice. Loader calls are made to the start of the page.
	* Configurable buffer page and zero-page range.
	* Manual in PDF format (Operator's Handbook).
	* Seekable load scripts (both Spin and Pefchain).
	* Support for streaming graphics and music.
	* Silencing of other drives on the IEC bus, with adaptive serial
	  transfer speed.
	* Simulated playroutine timing.
	* Generation of Vice script for memory boundary checks.
	* Additional directory art file formats.
	* 40-track mode.
	Drivecode performance improvements: Headerless scanning, triple sector
	buffers, IHS (Invented Here Stepping).
	Improved compression algorithm.
	Prebuilt binaries for Linux and Windows included.
	Removed support for loading directly to I/O registers and colour RAM.
	Serial transfers are no longer checksummed (to reduce resident size).
3.1	Reintroduced NTSC compatibility.

appreciate some credit, e.g. "Loader by lft".
